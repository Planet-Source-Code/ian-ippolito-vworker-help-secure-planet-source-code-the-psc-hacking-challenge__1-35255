### Description

Want to help keep your submissions on Planet Source Code as safe as possible from hackers as well as ensure that the voting system can't be manipulated? I am posting this entry up as a 'guinnea pig'. If you can modify it, (while following the rules below), you'll get a free copy of the Planet Source Code Cd for your troubles and the site will be enhanced against future attacks!

### Source Code

<p><b><font size="2">Rules of the 'PSC Hacking Challenge':</font></b><font size="2"><br>
<br>
You can win in one of two ways:</font></p>
<ol>
 <li><font size="2">If you can modify this submission in any way other than
 through normal functions given to all site users (i.e. change the # of votes
 without voting, change the submission title, contents, etc.) then you will win
 a copy of the Planet Source Code CD.<br>
 </font></li>
 <li><font size="2">If you can hack the login system and login as a user other
 than yourself.  </font><i><font size="2">(Note that simply creating
 multiple logins with multiple email addresses doesn't count--anyone can do
 that!) </font></i><font size="2"> To win the Cd, your exploit has to
 allow you to login as someone else whose account was created with an email
 address that you don't have access to.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="2">To win the CD you must:</font></p>
<p><font size="2">1) Report privately to me how you got around security. 
Send your email to
Webmasternospam@planet-source-code.com (note:remove the 'nospam' from the name...that
is there just to fool email name harvesters)..</font></p>
<p><font size="2">2) You can brag about it all you want...but please NOT before
I've had time to patch the site and post up the new code!</font></p>
<p><font size="2">3) You must not hack anything other than this submission. Submissions and feedback/comments are moderated, so you can't hack the site that way anyway. Please don't increase the moderators' work unnecessarily by posting "fake" submissions or feedback/comments.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2">4) One CD will be awarded to the first discoverer of each
security hole.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Thanks for helping to make Planet Source Code as secure as it
can be!</font></p>
